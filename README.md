# AuE8240_Autonomous_Driving_Technologies


Personal cars and commercial trucks are continuously improving the driver experience and safety thanks to integration of more significant and machine-assisted control systems. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are now integrated in all luxury cars and moving into mainstream products. Technologies covered by ADAS are specific for each car integrator, but increasingly they include now involving more safety features, such as driver assistance and partial delegation to autonomous control for small maneuvers such as lane control. The ADAS systems consists of control system such as:

- Lane departure warning system
- Speed assistance and control
- Autonomous emergency braking

## Projects tasks
### 1) Autonomous lane keeping: 
Given an on-track camera video, calculate the steering angle of the vehicle to track the lane, and design appropriate HMI to intuitively display the steering control in the image.
